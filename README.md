Selenium WebDriver with Cucumber Framework - Automated Regression Tests
Overview
This repository contains an automated regression testing framework built using Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber for a retail company's website. The framework aims to validate the success of a user journey (e.g., Item – Cart – Checkout) on the website SauceDemo.

Prerequisites
Before running the automated tests, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK)
Maven
Git
Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/selenium-cucumber-framework.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd selenium-cucumber-framework
Execute the following Maven command to download dependencies and build the project:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Running Tests
To execute the automated tests, use the following Maven command:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
By default, this will run the entire test suite defined in the src/test/resources/features directory.

To run specific scenarios or features, use tags in your Cucumber runner class or in the @CucumberOptions annotation. For example:

java
Copy code
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
        features = "src/test/resources/features",
        glue = "stepdefinitions",
        plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports", "rerun:target/rerun.txt"},
        dryRun = false,
        tags = "@ItemCartCheckout"
)
public class TestRunner {
    // ...
}
This configuration will only execute scenarios tagged with @ItemCartCheckout.

Framework Structure
src/main/java: Contains utility classes, configuration, and any reusable components.
src/test/java: Includes step definitions and test runners.
src/test/resources/features: Holds Gherkin syntax feature files describing test scenarios.
Test Data
Test data is managed in the src/test/resources/testdata directory. Ensure that test data is updated as needed for accurate test execution.

Reporting
Test execution results are generated in HTML format and stored in the target/cucumber-reports directory. Open the index.html file in a browser for detailed test results.
